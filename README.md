### Web Economics - VCG and Logistic Regression - Source code

This is the source code of the assignment I completed as part of the [COMPGW02 - Web Economics](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/teaching_learning/syllabus/msc_web_science_and_big_data_analytics/gw02_web_economics/) module (MSc Web Science and Big Data Analytics) which I undertook at UCL.

#### Assignment brief

The aim of this assignment was to experiment with:

* Part A: Real-time Bidding and Sponsored Search Auction
* Part B: Linear and Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent

##### Part A: Real-time Bidding and Sponsored Search Auction

The aim of the first part of this assignment was to help you understand some basic concepts and calculations in real-time
bidding (RTB) based display advertising. The second part involved working with a sponsored search auction and assigning bids to slots using the VCG mechanism.


##### Part B: Linear and Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent

In this assignment, I tested regression and logistic regression trained via gradient descent on the Spambase data set.

#### Instructions

To run the source code, follow the steps below:

##### Part A: Real-time Bidding and Sponsored Search Auction

```bash
# running VCG
python DriverSSA.py
```

##### Part B: Linear and Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent

To run the source code, you have to manually set up a project in an IDE that supports Scala. For this assignment, IntelliJ IDEA IDE was used.
